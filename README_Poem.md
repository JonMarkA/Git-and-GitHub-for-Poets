Hey you, stop stressin’ 'bout what you’re missin'
So blue, just take it easy, take your time
If you think my words are wise, just try it for yourself
I promise the stars will light the path you walk, don't give in
Got a heart of gold, what a shame to go to waste
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing

Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you’re losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side 
The other side 
Got you stuck in your mind 
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
